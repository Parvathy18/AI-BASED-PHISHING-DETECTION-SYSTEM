# AI-BASED-PHISHING-DETECTION-SYSTEM
____________________________________
This project is an AI-based phishing detection system that leverages both frontend and backend components to detect phishing attempts in real-time. It uses machine learning models trained on phishing datasets to classify suspicious URLs and email data.

# Project Structure
___________________
My-project-main/
> app.js - Frontend JavaScript logic
> app.py - Backend Flask application
> index.html - Main HTML page for the app
> pd.csv - Data file for analysis
> phishing_dataset.csv - Dataset for phishing detection
> train_models.py - Script for training models

# Features
__________
1. Real-Time Phishing Detection: Identifies phishing URLs and email headers instantly.
2. Model Training: Includes scripts to train machine learning models.
3. Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly interface for easy detection.

# Setup and Installation
________________________
> Install the dependencies:
        pip install -r requirements.txt

> Run the Flask application:
        python app.py

> Open index.html in your browser to interact with the application.

# Usage
________
> Navigate to the web interface and enter the URL or email header details to check for phishing threats.
> The model will provide real-time predictions.

# Training the Model
____________________
> To retrain the models, run:
     python train_models.py
This will update the model with new data from phishing_dataset.csv.
